# **done on earth : Revolutionizing Energy and Resource Utilization in Space**  

## **Our Mission:**

  To achieve 100% energy recycling within our solar system and return 99% of its generated value to contributors,
  
  while retaining only 1% for operational sustainability. Our ultimate goal is to construct a **Dyson bubble System**, 
  
  capturing and utilizing the vast energy resources of our solar system, propelling humanity toward an energy-abundant future.

  2. **Asteroid Mining Technology**  

  - Exploration and extraction of rare earth minerals from asteroids, tapping into a trillion-dollar industry.  

  - The acquired resources will fund the next phase and advance technologies in communications, landing systems, refining processes, and mineral recovery—crucial for subsequent missions.  

  --
  
  3. **Energy Recovery and Resource Transmission**  

  - Deployment of drones to transport energy recovery equipment to asteroids.  

  - Collect solar energy and rare earth resources, transmitting them back to Earth to meet societal needs.  

  - Ultimately, progress toward constructing a **Dyson bubble System** for the **100% recycling of solar energy**, unlocking limitless possibilities for humanity.
